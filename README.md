# Perfect Day Planner READ.ME

# Description/Purpose

The Perfect Day Planner is time-tracking tool that will allow the user to see past scheduled events, the present scheduled activities, and what may be coming up in the future.

On any given day, the current DATE will load at the top of the page.  One hour time slots beginning at 9am and ending at 5pm provide the user with a place to input their daily work schedule.  A save button on the right hand side will ensure that the activity will remain on the page on subsequent days until it is updated by the user.

The time slots are color coded gray, red and green; so that the user can easily see what scheduled items are past, present and future.
